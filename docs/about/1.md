# About this wiki

This personal wiki collects the "raw" documentation, the notes taken by reading, and tracking study status.

It was designed based on *Zettelkasten*, AKA slip box.

Here is some part of this wiki.

## Inbox

The inbox is the place that collects the "raw" documentation. The "raw" documentation means the documentation has never been proceeded. It s the most original, just like raw meat.

## Fleet notes

the fleet notes capture the mind at a moment, but it needs to proceed to the Permanent notes, which I'll introduce later.

## Literature notes

When I finish reading a book, some essay, or anything else, I'll record something I like or write down some feelings about it.

## Permanent notes

It's produced by myself, with the help of the Fleet notes and Literature notes.
