## Inspiration Notes

Inspiration Notes are used to capture any inspirations that come to mind at any time. They focus on recording inspirations and do not emphasize formatting.

### Numbering

The identifier for Inspiration Notes is: FN

::: tip How to Number

Correct numbering: FN1; FN2; FN3

Incorrect numbering: FN0001; FN3a

:::

### Other Notes

In the slip box definition, there should be periodic clearance of Inspiration Notes. However, in this Wiki, we adopt a non-clearance mode but assign a specific number and date to facilitate searching.

## Literature Notes

In the slip box, Literature Notes involve summarizing specific literature in one's own words after reading. In this Wiki, we redefine this concept.

#### 1. The Nine-Rank System and Imperial Examination System

#### 1.1 The Nine-Rank System

- **Definition**: The Nine-Rank System was an official selection system established by the Cao Wei during the Tang Dynasty, which lasted for a long time. It selected officials based on their family background, morality, and abilities.
- **Brief Explanation**: The Nine-Rank System evaluated officials' status and positions using nine grades, with higher grades indicating higher positions.

**Aid to Understanding**: While the system initially served the purpose of selecting talent, over time, it became a tool for the privileged aristocracy due to excessive emphasis on family background, leading to the loss of fairness in talent selection.

##### 1.2 Imperial Examination System

- **Definition**: The Imperial Examination System was introduced after the Nine-Rank System was abolished during the Sui Dynasty. It was a system similar to modern examination for selecting officials.
- **Development**: The system originated during the Sui Emperor Yang's reign and was inherited and continuously updated during the Tang Dynasty.
- **Tang Dynasty Updates**: Emperor Taizong added new subjects, Empress Wu expanded the number of exam candidates, and Wuju (military examination) and Dianshi (palace examination) were created. Emperor Xuanzong appointed high-ranking officials to oversee the examinations (examiners).

**Aid to Understanding**: The Imperial Examination System was a fairer and more open system for selecting officials through examinations compared to the Nine-Rank System. The Tang Dynasty continuously improved the examination system by introducing new subjects and examination formats, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of selecting officials.

### 2. Three Departments and Six Ministries System

- **Definition**: Emperor Wen of Sui established the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, including the Central Chancellery, the Department of State Affairs, and the Department of State Secretariat, as well as six ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, and Public Works.
- **Role**: The Three Departments acted as the positions of the prime minister, expanding the scope of prime minister appointments. The establishment of the Policy Bureau improved work efficiency, reflecting the trend of integration of the three departments.
- **Issues**: Excessive power of the prime minister led to corruption, and conflicts and contradictions between departments may arise, leading to the phenomenon of Factionalism.

**Aid to Understanding**: The Three Departments and Six Ministries system was a relatively efficient political system that managed state affairs by dividing them among the three departments and six ministries. However, the excessive power of the prime minister brought about corruption, and conflicts between ministries might affect the stability of the government.

### 3. Taxation System

- **Wei-Jin Period**: Implemented the Rent and Labor Tax System, collecting grain and silk from households.
- **Reforms by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei**: Issued the Equal Field System, stipulating that each man with one wife should pay grain as rent and silk or cloth as labor tax.
- **Early Tang Taxation**: Targeted men aged 21 to 59, except for rent and labor taxes, non-levied men could contribute silk or cloth as substitutes for conscription (Yong).
- **Two-Tax System in the Tianbao Era**: Each household paid a population-based and asset-based tax (household tax) and a land tax based on cultivated acres, abolishing rent, labor, and miscellaneous taxes, with taxes collected twice a year in summer and autumn.

The above templates are not set in stone; different subjects may give rise to different templates. However, the core ideas include the following:

- Correct title hierarchy for ease of finding and locating knowledge points.
- Clear identification of recorded knowledge points, such as what a particular paragraph refers to and its significance.
- Use of charts and diagrams to assist in recording.
- Need for change records.

### Change Records

If there are any changes to Literature Notes, a table recording each change must be added at the beginning of the file. The old file must be kept on GitHub, and a link should be provided at the corresponding location in the Wiki.

Table example:

| Version | Change Description | Change Date |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| v1.0.0  | Created            | 7/29        |
| v1.0.1  | Supplemented       | 8/21        |
|         |                    |             |

### Numbering

The identifier for Literature Notes is: LN (Literature Notes); derived from the initials of "Literature Notes."

The numbering rule is:

::: tip How to Number

Correct numbering: LN-vuepress; LN-history; LN-Math

### Other Notes

For early note arrangement, tools like ChatGPT may be used for assistance. However, once the formatting is mature, it needs to be dissociated from tools like ChatGPT.

## Permanent Notes

Permanent Notes are used to assess the learning status of knowledge. The format is more like rewriting a textbook.

::: warning

As the project has not yet reached this stage, many related contents are waiting to be supplemented.

### Numbering

The identifier for Permanent Notes is: PN (Permanent Notes).
