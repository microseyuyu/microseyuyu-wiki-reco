## *ru-verbs*

Ru-verbs means that you add the suffix 'る' after the verb base, just like:

a. 食べ -> 食べる

b. 起き -> 起きる

a. means eat; when we conjugate it into *taberu*, the word's status has changed, But the base doesn't change.

*taberu* still means eat, but the status changed into 'to eat'.

## *u-verbs*

Then, the *ru-verbs* means the word add a suffix 'る,' so *u-verbs* could also mean the word add a suffix 'う'?

The answer is: definitely no.

*U-verbs* mean in the conjugation, the letter will switch in the same row of *the hiragana* chart, just like:

a. 行く -> 行き

b. 飲む -> 飲み

in a. we could learn that く just simply switching into き, whatever く and き, both of their conjugation is happening in the か row of the *hiragana* chart.

In b. , the む switching into み just essential happened in the ま row of the *hiragana* chart.

## The "dictionary form."

The dictionary form is not restricted from the bases form of the dictionary; it just means a lot of dictionaries will show you form like する or くる when you search the dictionary for 'to do' or 'to come.'

## The present tense affirmative forms

it means that some words have the same meaning in dictionary form but spread positive meaning, just like

食べます (i'm) to eat 

## The present tense negative forms

it means that some words have the same meaning in dictionary form but spread positive meaning, just like:

食べません (I'm) not to eat

## Stems

The bases with *ru-verbs*, and bases plus *i* with *u-verbs*, just like:

し

き

## "irregular verbs"

We have known *ru-verbs* and *u-verbs* at the beginning, but here are some conjugations outside of them, just like:

する -> します (to do)

くる -> きます (to come)

These 2 verbs normally suffix, like ’勉強する’.

- The vowels are different from the dictionary forms, but why?



## How to memorize this conjugation?

Make these verbs a set to memorize the dictionary form and present the affirmative form.
